"""Every redirect target in the payslip views must actually reverse.

`create_payslip`, `add_bonus` and `add_deduction` all redirected to the URL
name `view-payslip` with a `payslip_id` kwarg. That name belongs to a *list*
view taking no arguments:

    payroll/urls/component_urls.py   view-payslip/                -> view-payslip
    payroll/urls/urls.py             view-payslip/<int:id>/       -> view-created-payslip

so the reverse raised NoReverseMatch -> HTTP 500, *after* save_payslip() had
already committed. ATOMIC_REQUESTS is unset (Django default False), so the
payslip was durable: the user saw an error page for an operation that had in
fact succeeded, and clicking Create again produced a duplicate for the same
employee and period.

The giveaway that it was a typo rather than intent: the notification seven
lines above the create_payslip redirect already used `view-created-payslip`.

Asserting the reverse directly rather than exercising the views: the defect is
entirely in the URL name, and a view-level test would need a contract, a
period and a full payslip computation to reach the same line.
