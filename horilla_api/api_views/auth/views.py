    Refuse a refresh token that was issued before the password changed.

    ``CHECK_REVOKE_TOKEN`` is enforced in exactly one place upstream:
    ``JWTAuthentication.get_user()``, which runs only when an *access* token
    authenticates a request. ``TokenRefreshSerializer.validate()`` checks the
    signature, the expiry and ``USER_AUTHENTICATION_RULE`` -- and never looks
    at the revoke claim. So a refresh token survived the password change that
    was supposed to end the session, and because rotation mints a replacement
    on every call it could be renewed indefinitely for the full refresh
    lifetime.

    Verified before this fix: refresh after a password change returned 200 and
    a fresh token pair; the access token it issued was then rejected with 401,
    because ``access_token`` copies the stale hash across. So the practical
    effect was a session that could not be used but also could not be killed
    -- and the safety of the whole 30-day window rested on one setting staying
    on, and on nothing ever using ``JWTStatelessUserAuthentication``, which
    skips the check by design.

    Checked here rather than left to the access token so that a password reset
