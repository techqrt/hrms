"""
Screen-shaped aggregates for the mobile client.

Everything else in this API is resource-shaped, and rightly so. The home
screen is the exception: it renders punch state, today's hours, a role band,
who is on leave, the latest announcement and an unread badge, which came to
eight or more round trips on a cold start over a mobile network. The previous
Flutter app made fourteen.

Deliberately narrow. This returns exactly what the home screen draws and
nothing else -- it is a view of existing data, not a second API. Resist
growing it into a general-purpose "give me everything" endpoint; if another
screen needs an aggregate, it gets its own, so each one stays readable and
cheap.
