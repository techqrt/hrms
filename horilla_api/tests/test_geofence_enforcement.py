"""
The geo-fence must fail *closed* on the punch endpoints.

``ClockInAPIView``/``ClockOutAPIView`` previously wrapped the whole fence
check in a bare ``except: pass``. A missing company, an absent ``geo_fencing``
relation, or a geopy timeout inside the location check therefore allowed the
punch -- the exact case the fence exists to prevent. These tests pin the
corrected behaviour: an *enabled* fence that cannot be evaluated denies.

Deliberately unit tests over ``geofence_denial`` rather than end-to-end
endpoint tests: the call sites are two lines each, while every branch that
matters lives in the helper, and driving clock-in end to end would drag in
shifts, schedules and work-info fixtures that prove nothing extra here.

Note that ``geofencing`` *is* installed, though not from settings -- it is
appended to INSTALLED_APPS as an import side effect in
``horilla_api/__init__.py``. The enforcement path this covers is live.
