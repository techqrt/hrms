"""
``/health/`` identifies the product without disclosing the release.

Mobile clients probe a user-typed host with this before posting credentials,
so that a wrong host reports "not a Horilla server" instead of "invalid
credentials". The endpoint must therefore stay unauthenticated and must carry
enough for that decision -- and no more.

The "no more" is the security half: this route is reachable by anyone, and the
project's published advisories name exact patched versions, so returning
``__version__`` here would let a scan map a host onto the advisories that
apply to it. That is what the second test guards.
