"""Archiving an employee must revoke their ability to log in.

Archiving is the obvious, reversible way to offboard someone, and it is what
an HR user reaches for instead of deleting. It did not touch login at all.

Two independent faults, which masked each other:

    employee.is_active = not employee.is_active                    # True -> False
    employee.employee_user_id.is_active = not employee.is_active   # -> not False = True
    ...
    employee.save()        # the user object is never saved

The assignment negated the *already flipped* value, so it set the user's flag
to the employee's previous state -- backwards. It never mattered, because only
the employee was saved. Fixing the save alone would have turned a no-op into
archiving *enabling* logins, which is why both halves are pinned here.

The gate that matters is ``HorillaUser.is_active``: ``CompanyScopedBackend``
subclasses ``ModelBackend`` without overriding ``user_can_authenticate``, which
is ``return getattr(user, "is_active", True)`` and knows nothing about
``Employee.is_active``. So these tests assert against ``authenticate()`` rather
than against the flag alone -- the flag is the mechanism, authentication is the
property that was broken.
